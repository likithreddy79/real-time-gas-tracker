This is a real-time gas tracker app that shows the base and priority gas fees for Ethereum, Polygon, and Arbitrum networks. It connects to Alchemy’s WebSocket API to get live block data and updates the gas info every few seconds. I built this using Next.js (React framework), Zustand for state management, Ethers.js for blockchain connection, and Tailwind CSS for styling. The app fetches the latest block from each chain and displays the baseFee and priorityFee in real time. It runs on localhost and doesn’t require any backend setup. To use it, clone the repo, run npm install, and paste your Alchemy WebSocket API keys inside src/utils/rpc.ts. Then use npm run dev to start the server. The app will show Ethereum gas fees live on the homepage, and you can also extend it to show Polygon and Arbitrum. I made this project to learn how live blockchain data works and how to manage state in a real app. The code is simple and beginner-friendly, and I’ve kept everything clean and organized so it’s easy to understand.
